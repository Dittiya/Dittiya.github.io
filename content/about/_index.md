## Brief Introduction
Hi! I do stuff mostly related with computer. Just like everyone in the tech space, I am the designated family IT guy. But I dabble in 
other things such as:
- Machine Learning (hobby)
- Web development (also hobby)
- Automations 
- Keyboards (another hobby)

## Work History

{{< timeline >}}

{{< timelineItem icon="code" header="Web Developer" >}}
This is where I started (professionally). A simple website for internal use where I took charge of routing, middleware, APIs, and data validation. Small project using Laravel that was done in 2 months.

{{< timelineItem icon="bug" header="Software QA Engineer" >}}
Fun little internship that I did for a year. Plenty of important business-related practices to learn in this position as it sits between products and development teams. Of course I wasted no time in sharpening my technical skills here. Writing test cases, bug finding, test automations, and E2E testing has since been available in my arsenal thanks to this role.
